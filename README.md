# ProcessingLearningStage
Here's where I'm going to post all the code I've submitted to the Valencia COP1000 course, as well as any personal projects I've completed.

Any code you find in this album is open for you to tinker with and play around with. Improve upon, perhaps. But I mostly decided to make a GitHub to track my progress as I learn to code, as this is a MAJOR step in my life. Much like my YouTube channel shows my progress learning various topics over the years, I want my GitHub to grow with my projects.
